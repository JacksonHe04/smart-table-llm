问题: which players came in last?
预期答案: Chris Banks,Sallieu Bundu,George Davis IV,Sainey Touray
模型答案: There is no clear "last" in a specific sense as all players have their respective rankings and goal counts.

If considering by goal count, it's a bit more complex as there are multiple players with the same goal count.
