问题: compare which region has the best buffer zone
预期答案: Chornohora
模型答案: It is difficult to simply determine which region has the "best" buffer zone as it depends on specific criteria. However, among the regions presented, Presov has relatively large buffer zones in some cases (such as for the Presov preserved areas and Poloniny National Park). Zakarpattia also has significant buffer zone areas in some of its nature reserves. Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has notable buffer zone sizes in Jasmund and Müritz National Parks. Brandenburg's Grumsiner Forest Nature Reserve also has a buffer zone. Each region has its own characteristics and the assessment of the "best" buffer zone is context-dependent.
